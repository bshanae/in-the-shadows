Remake of mobile game 'Shadowmatic'.
The gameplay consists of rotating some shitty strange models to get a real object from their shadows.

I used Unity HDRP for implementation of this project.

## Build

Download the project. Open Unity (you need version 2020.3.9f1).
Then build regularly by pressing 'cmd + B'.
A Mac OS executable will be generated.

## Controls

* `LMB` to rotate figure horizontally and vertically
* `LMB` + `alt` to rotate figure in parallel to background
* `LMB` + `cmd` to rotate figure set

## Resources

* Many, but this [guy helped](https://www.youtube.com/user/Brackeys) me most
